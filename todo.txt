Questions:
Does a publisher have a significance difference in sales of different regions?
How many games were sold in a given year?
How does the genre affect ratings and sales?
How are critic scores different from user scores? Which game has the highest delta?
How does the publisher affect critic scores (bribing)?
How does the maturity rating affect rating and sales?

Future questions:
Can critic scores of new games be predicted?
How does the title affect sales?
How does an exclusive release affect sales?

Issues:
Ratings dependent on MetaCritic, which only lists a subset of the games.

Effort to sustain:
VGchartz and MetaCritic databases have to be scratched for every new game. The workflow will be the same every time.
The underlying idea doesn't change.
